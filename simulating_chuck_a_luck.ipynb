    "## \"Pay a Buck and Chuck-a-Luck\" \n",
    "\n",
    "[Chuck-a-Luck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck-a-luck) is a game of chance often associated with charity fundraisers or street gambling rather than casinos. \n",
    "\n",
    "To play, the House says, \"Pay $1, pick a number and roll 3 dice. If any of those dice come up, you'll win $1, $2, or $3\". \n",
    "\n",
    "> \"It's even odds\", they say, \"because the probability of rolling your number is 1/6 and you get to roll 3 dice! 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 is 3/6 which is 1/2\". \n",
    "\n",
    "You know better than this, so it's time to make an experiment to approximate the actual risk and payoff...\n",
    "\n",
    "Rules:\n",
    "- The player pays $1 to play and picks a number.\n",
    "- The House rolls 3 dice at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Payouts:\n",
    "  - $3 if all three dice match the chosen number\n",
    "  - $2 if exactly two dice match the chosen number\n",
    "  - $1 is exactly one of the dice matches the chosen number\n",
    "  - If none of the dice match the player's chosen number, then the House keeps the $1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercises:\n",
    "- If you play 1,000,000 games in a row, what are your winnings/losses?\n",
    "- Chart out a histogram of all the outcomes of those 1,000,000 games\n",
    "- Is this really a fair game of 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 odds?\n",
    "- If you were to extrapolate the expected winnings per game, what would that number approach per game? "
